# Foundry VTT Lightweight PTA System

A partial implementation of Pokemon Tabletop Adventures for Foundry VTT.

- Trainer character sheets with feature lists and inventory.
- Move and feature item support.
- Move macros on the hotbar when dragged from the item list.
- Metronome!

Some of this implementation is specific to the campaign I'm in, so you might want to rip that out (specifically the "League Application" section of the character sheet).
